# This pkg-config file lets you use the compiled lib without having to first
# install it anywhere. Simply put the directory the pkg-config file is in on the
# PKG_CONFIG_PATH and look for portmidi_s as normal - the uninstalled file 
# is prefered to the installed one if both are found

# The library always ends up in the build dir.
